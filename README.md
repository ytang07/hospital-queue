# hospital-queue
672 final project + interactive.py

The files contained in here were created in the process of making an event based simulation for hospital emergency room queues during
mass casualty incidents. The interactive.py file uses Tkinter and allows the user/researcher/expert to pick the patient and hospital at pickup times.
Currently, the program prints out information to the console. To have this information printed out into windows the following issues must be addressed:

1. Having the ambulance information show up in a table format - must find a way to allow variable number of rows
2. Having the hospital information show up in a table format - same issue as ambulance
3. If doing instead of one window with a table, we can also use a new window for each ambulance and hospital but then we have to find a way to shut all of these windows down at the same time
